# Individual-Project

Used to hand in individual project

The code is working perfectly. In the Jupyter Notebook, I take an example, 10 and 10 as the width and length of the space, 
as well as 6 as the number of towers the user wants to create. You can run the commented code in the function, which is the 
example provided in the assignment.
